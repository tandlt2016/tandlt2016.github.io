                        <p>I have always known that family does not always mean shared blood. Lily is my older sister, even though we aren’t officially related. She held me when I was just four months old, and is still my support today. If anything, I am still known for copying Lily. Lily has always been a roll model. If she wore a big bow in her hair, I would do the same. She went to Mount Holyoke, so I went to Mount Holyoke. She moved to NYC and I followed quickly behind. I cannot explain the bond I have with her but I guess it can be summed up as “sisters”.</p>

                        <h4>Officiant</h4>
                        <p>Elena and I are much more than college sophomore roommates. I have known this girl since Kindergarten. Our families vacation together to Maine, and our parents have a friendship of their own. We are different in our beliefs and our likes and dislikes, and yet I probably know Elena better than most people would believe. Our friendship is childlike and still innocent. Due to this, we have had to work harder for a friendship later in our life. We both have grown, and each have our own way of interacting with one another. Yet, there are just a few people I truly love, and Elena is one of those people. I would bet if we took a couple’s test about how well we know one another, we could dominate. I am so happy Elena will be officially the one to marry me. </p>
