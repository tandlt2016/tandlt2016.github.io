                        <h4>Matron of Honor</h4>
                        <p>I have always known that family does not always mean shared blood. Lily is my older sister, even though we aren’t officially related. She held me when I was just four months old, and is still my support today. If anything, I am still known for copying Lily. Lily has always been a roll model. If she wore a big bow in her hair, I would do the same. She went to Mount Holyoke, so I went to Mount Holyoke. She moved to NYC and I followed quickly behind. I cannot explain the bond I have with her but I guess it can be summed up as “sisters”.</p>

                        <p>I met Katrina my senior year of college. I had seen her from afar in the cafeteria, and for some strange reason thought our paths would never cross. When they did, we had an instant connection. Our friendship grew exponentially in the last six years. Our happiness has been tested due to serious situations in our everyday life, and yet this has only gotten us closer. Katrina is the kind of friend that is a gift. I am proud to have such an amazing friend as my Maid of Honor.</p>

                        <h4>Officiant</h4>
                        <p>Elena and I are much more than college sophomore roommates. I have known this girl since Kindergarten. Our families vacation together to Maine, and our parents have a friendship of their own. We are different in our beliefs and our likes and dislikes, and yet I probably know Elena better than most people would believe. Our friendship is childlike and still innocent. Due to this, we have had to work harder for a friendship later in our life. We both have grown, and each have our own way of interacting with one another. Yet, there are just a few people I truly love, and Elena is one of those people. I would bet if we took a couple’s test about how well we know one another, we could dominate. I am so happy Elena will be officially the one to marry me.</p>

                        <p>Leah is my best friend in the whole wide world. We met when Leah was in preschool and I was in Kindergarten. I remember seeing Leah looking at me. This freaked me out. Leah then told her mom that she was going to be my friend. I guess she got her way. Leah and I are different on the outside. I live in the city of Philadelphia, and Leah just spent more than half a year living in a VW van. Yet, when you look close, these differences do not define our friendship. Our capability to care and love for one another is what keeps our friendship fresh and kind.</p>

                        <p>Sally and I met in homeroom in middle school. I do not know how we became friends or what the defining moment was, but whenever it happened, I am glad it did. Sally and I have found common ground on serious and not so serious topics. From personal upsets, to seeing Spring Breakers twice in theaters, we supported one another through upsetting and also silly moments in our lives. Sally grounds me and helps me from getting lost in my head. I am so happy Sally and Tyler have created an independent strong friendship. Sally is Tyler’s frisbee golf date, which gets me out of playing :)</p>

                        <p>Amanda and I have been friends since Sophomore year at Mount Holyoke College. I met her the first day of Geology Lab. Even though we both did not do great in the class, we created a strong friendship. I have always been fascinated by Amanda’s artistic talent and her relaxed demeanor. I try to be better because of her. I love spending time with her family and always feel welcomed by the wonderful feast they provide. I feel so happy that she can spend this awesome day with us. If you look around the wedding, Amanda’s artistic talent will be in the details. </p>

                        <p>Julia keeps me in line. She keeps me level headed in times when I am just overly emotional. My friendship with Julia began as co-workers at Tribeca Film Institute. She was the other Korean girl. I honestly was scared of Julia when I met her. She was so strong and such a hard worker, I felt that I would be too weak to be friends with her. However, I quickly began to look up to her. She taught me that I could be a strong employee and a strong friend. Julia is one of those friends who I know will always be there. I think she has learned to deal with me, and I am thankful for that! I always stay with her when I go back to NYC which makes me feel completely relaxed and at home.</p>
